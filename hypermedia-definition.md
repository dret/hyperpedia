# A Definition of Hypermedia

*Hypermedia* refers to a model of providing and using information that is a combination of the two terms *Hypertext* and *Multimedia*.

## Hypertext

*Hypertext* refers to the fact that separate information units are made available as individually navigable resources, and that these resources are interconnected by *hyperlinks*. Consumers of hypertext follow navigation paths. For this to work, *links* must be clearly identified within individual resources, and they must be meaningfully navigable so that clients can make decisions which links to follow.

Interactions along links take clients from one resource to the next. Interactions can have whatever meaning the resource provider assigns to them, specifically they can be richer than just interacting with static data.

## Multimedia

*Multimedia* refers to the fact that the resources provided in a hypermedia context can use a variety of media types. Traditionally, it meant that information representation and display goes beyond simple text. Architecturally, it means that a hypermedia architecture must be capable of representing a variety of media types, and that clients potentially must be able to navigate through these various types.

This does not imply that all clients must be able to navigate all media types. It depends both on the resource providers and on application authors which media types they want to use for their needs, and which ones they just choose to create or consume.
